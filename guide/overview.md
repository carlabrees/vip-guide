# 1 Overview

On December 31, 2015, the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) implemented a new Information Technology (IT) delivery and governance framework that encompasses the portfolio/program/project levels.

The Veteran-focused Integration Process (VIP), a Lean-Agile framework, services the interest of Veterans through the efficient streamlining of activities occurring within the IT enterprise. This effort prioritizes the increasing value to the Veteran, information security, portfolio management, and continuous organizational learning and improvement within the VA.

VIP is a significant step forward for VA, allowing more frequent delivery of essential IT services benefitting the Veteran by utilizing a minimal oversight process. VIP also enhances the ability to track and monitor IT performance and strengthens management oversight and accountability. VIP incorporates portfolio-centered strategic planning, Agile development methodology, a three-month cadence, two Critical Decisions, and a single integration release cycle.

VIP propels the Department with even more rigor toward Veteran-focused delivery and sustainment of IT capabilities and infrastructure projects. The VIP framework unifies and streamlines IT delivery oversight, and enables efficient delivery of secure and predictable IT solutions. With VIP, VA takes another generational leap forward in its commitment to serve our nation's Veterans.

**V** = **Veteran**-focused. This policy prioritizes Veteran needs and it empowers employees to deliver excellent customer service for improvement of the Veteran experience. From an IT perspective, this means VA will focus project efforts on Veteran outcomes, rather than complex processes and documentation. OIT will focus on building value for the Veteran, through easier access to integrated health care, benefits, and other services.

**I** = a single **Integration** release process. OIT eliminated the numerous independent groups, staffed by more than 90 individuals, with over 10 processes to conduct reviews and assessments in the latter stage of the Product Phase. With VIP, compliance organizations are monitoring progress and the implementation of the requirements during the entire development cycle, rather than just at the end.

**P** = **Process** which includes Portfolios, Programs and Projects. Portfolios, Programs, and Projects facilitate the integration of information-sharing and communication requisite for a successful IT management program. VIP reoriented its organizational structure to allow OIT to better divide responsibility and streamline the oversight process.

This guide serves as a reference of VIP policies, definitions, and procedural regulations for VA and OIT community.

## 1.1 Purpose

The primary goal of VIP is:

**_To increase the speed of delivering high-quality, secure, and sustainable IT capabilities to benefit the Veteran._**

To achieve this goal, VIP enables a flexible project management process that allows VA to deliver usable and beneficial products centered on the needs of users through frequent releases. By increasing the frequency of releases, decreasing the requirements for large amounts of documentation and oversight, and focusing on the continued sustainment and operation of deployed systems, VIP helps to succeed in meeting this objective.

## 1.2 Projects That Will Employ VIP

The VIP Framework is mandated for any project effort that touches the VA network, regardless of whether it spends government funds from VA's Congressional IT Appropriation or from another appropriation, per the VIP [Memorandum](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Policy%20%20Guidance/Approval_for_the_Veteran_focused_Integrated_Process.pdf) signed on Dec. 31, 2015 by LaVerne Council, Assistant Secretary for Information Technology. This mandate includes projects that complete a Critical Decision 1 (CD1), but are not required to complete a Critical Decision 2 (CD2) because of non-deployment into production. Projects that complete a CD1 and not a CD2 need the Project Manager (PM) and/or Contracting Officer Representative to verify completion of met requirements prior to closing the project.

However, there are conditions that apply in different circumstances. Because one size does not fit all and different products have different needs, VIP strives to appropriately tailor the requirements to the product.

To the maximum extent possible, all spending of government funds on IT must employ both VIP and Agile processes. This will vary based on the type of product, which is why Portfolio Directors are allowed to modify VIP processes for specific products. When pursuing new products, OIT strives to buy existing products before building a new product, and prefers cloud solutions. Even if a product is not a standard software development project, it must still follow VIP and Agile best practices. A number of examples are provided in Appendix B. If there is any uncertainty about whether a project must follow VIP, contact the VBO at [vavip@va.gov](mailto:vavip@va.gov) for guidance.

## 1.3 Principles

VIP aligns itself with the following six core principles:

### 1.3.1 Prioritize the Needs of Veterans and Users

By keeping the priorities of Veterans and users at the forefront of policy, VIP ensures an outcome that meets their needs. The needs of users drive decision-making—not the needs of the VA, nor the personal preferences of leadership.

### 1.3.2 Test Early and Often

With VIP, VA wants to deliver a secure and reliable product to users early and often. Testing throughout the IT project lifecycle with the intended user of the product is the best way to ensure the outcome will be usable and provide the user-requested functionality. Stakeholders will have opinions and ideas about how a product should look or work; and these will be considered. However, VA will rely on direct feedback from end-users, coupled with the IT development knowledge of seasoned IT Subject Matter Experts to confirm that the most appropriate technological solution is being used to meet the Product Owner's business requirements.

### 1.3.3 Welcome Change Throughout the Project Lifecycle

Additional requirements that are discovered through development and testing are prioritized by the Project Team and Product Owner in the backlog. By utilizing Agile methodology, OIT fosters an environment that is both adaptable and reflective.

### 1.3.4 Work Closely with all Stakeholders

Success requires close collaboration across the team—from the IT Project Team to the Release Agent to the Product Owner and Receiving Organization. We communicate early and often to make transparent decisions. Agile development methodologies require development teams to meet often with Stakeholders to ensure transparency and foster a collaborative work environment.

### 1.3.5 Measure Progress by Delivery

OIT's Project Teams deliver solution(s) that meets the needs of the end-users as the principal measure of progress. A frequent delivery cadence means that end-users should experience tangible improvements regularly. Documents do not equate to progress; progress is a working product or service.

### 1.3.6 Value Simplicity

VIP does not create documentation for the sake of documentation, nor does it create complex processes when a simple one will suffice. This policy values trust and works in a principles-based manner, not a rules-based hierarchy. OIT will not answer the same questions multiple times in different formats. To work in an Agile manner, this governance process must have clear and simple processes that avoid redundancy.

## 1.4 Objectives

In accordance with the principles listed above, VIP is committed to the following institutional priorities:

### 1.4.1 Security

The first priority of OIT is the safety and security of Veteran data. Security is not just a check-point or a document; it is embedded in the process by the Project Team. Security requirements are identified at the start of the project, addressed throughout development, then confirmed and tested before the product is placed into production.

### 1.4.2 User Satisfaction

An IT project is not successful unless it meets the needs of the end-user. Throughout the VIP Lifecycle of each project, the Product Owner, representing product users, will have a key role in the decision-making process during the development of the product. As one of the three decision-makers for Critical Decisions, the Product Owner will be able to regularly express concerns and/or approvals to best meet user satisfaction.

### 1.4.3 Portfolio Approach

By transitioning from a project-based to a portfolio-based structure, VIP enables projects and their Project Teams to operate within a common framework. Grouping similar projects into portfolios ensures more effective management of resources and allow for a portfolio-level focus on tasks like release processes and risk management. This structure also enables more sharing of effective trends and successful patterns.

### 1.4.4 Accountability and Transparency

VIP enhances accountability and measures performance through data-driven metrics and simplified approval processes. Data is made available at the portfolio/program/project levels. With the utilization of three key decision-makers in the VIP Lifecycle, data will be more fluidly communicated and foster an environment of transparency.

### 1.4.5 Continuous Improvement

VA is committed to continuous learning and evaluations. VIP allows VA to gather lessons learned by taking an analytical view at both successes and failures and then sharing these opportunities for improvement with the enterprise. In addition, OIT will reevaluate its governance and IT management processes continuously to ensure they stay lean.

## 1.5 VIP Roles and Responsibilities

Successful outcomes require an effective Project Team, aware of roles and responsibilities, with a clear understanding of the objective and scope of the project, and the needs of all users and Stakeholders. While roles and responsibilities may vary from project to project, the following key roles are included in VIP (although not every role is required for every project):

### 1.5.1 Product Owner

The Product Owner is an individual in the business office within VA that sponsors the _solution_ by expressing the requirement for the product. The Product Owner is the organization's representative of the individuals who will be served by the product. The Product Owner drives the business requirements (Epics, sub-Epics, and User Stories). The Product Owner, along with the PM, is responsible for prioritizing the project backlog in activities such as Sprint Planning. The Product Owner is one of the three decision-makers (VIP Triad) for CD1s and CD2s.

The Product Owner or Designee:

- Provides business requirements
- Defines project goals, scope, Epics, sub-Epics, user stories, roles, and priorities
- Serves as part of the Scrum Team and makes day-to-day decisions on behalf of their business office
- Prioritizes the backlog
- Approves/accepts the product

A successful and effective Product Owner will have daily contact with the Project Team, invest in understanding the needs of their users, and trust that the information provided by the Project Team with respect to operations is reliable, but verify that information is accurate. The Product Owner will be a partner to the Project Team and participate as an active member of the Scrum Team. As such, the Product Owner prioritizes the needs of their users above all, and makes decisions on behalf of the business office represented. The Product Owner will also be engaged in the Project Close Out Phase actions and participate in the transition to the Receiving Organization and Sustainment Phase of the Product Lifecycle.

### 1.5.2 IT Account Manager

The IT Account Manager (ITAM) collaborates with the Business Stakeholders to understand the business needs and requirements. The ITAM is responsible for coordinating with the Product Owner to create new VIP Requests (VIPR) and for submitting them for portfolio-level review. The ITAM also works with the Portfolio Director to triage the requests and further define the requirements. ITAMs are responsible for arranging and brokering the meetings between alignment groups and the business to select the appropriate Alignment Epics for the product.

An ITAM serves as the lead IT executive reporting to the CIO and is responsible for the creation and management of the business partner's portfolio. An ITAM provides strategic leadership to maximize value by managing IT product prioritization, balancing portfolios, and allocating resources. He or she is the primary contact between IT and the business partner, interfaces with industry, and serves as a catalyst to drive innovation. ITAMs collect data about OIT performance throughout all VA. This information facilitates OIT issue resolution, change management, and enterprise innovation.

### 1.5.3 VIP Triad

The VIP Triad consists of the Portfolio Director, the Product Owner and the Receiving Organization Representative. The VIP Triad is the decision group for CD1s and CD2s. The VIP Triad is also the decision group for VIP Triad Technical Reviews (TechRevs) where they have direct oversight of the project.

**NOTE:** The VIP Triad consists of members that have direct oversight of the project/product and can make real-time informative decisions in support of the project lifecycle.

### 1.5.4 IT Portfolio Director

The IT Portfolio Director oversees a larger grouping of similar projects organized into programs. A successful IT Portfolio Director creates and manages the framework in which their programs operate, ensuring an environment that positions the programs for success; and ensures the needs of the user and Veteran are addressed. This individual must have a close working relationship with their Program Managers, advocating for them within the larger VIP and OIT context.

The IT Portfolio Director ensures the use of Agile methodologies, comprehends the needs of the Product Owner and other Stakeholders, and addresses the needs of the VA. The IT Portfolio Director strives to meet VIP and other VA compliance measures, and is one of the three decision-makers (VIP Triad) for CD1s and CD2s. The VIP SharePoint site offers guidelines that assist the IT Portfolio Director in assessing a product's risk and visibility, to determine what level of VIP guidance a project should follow. If an IT Portfolio Director is not able to attend a CD, they have the authorization, via a duly signed [Delegation of Authority (DOA)](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Pages/Policy%20and%20Guidance.aspx) memo, to designate a Voting Proxy in their place. In addition, the IT Portfolio Director will serve as the lead contact/POC for the development lifecycle of all projects, programs, and systems within the portfolio. Part of that effort ensures the completion of sustainment operations and maintenance cost elements including technical debt.

### 1.5.5 Receiving Organization

The office responsible for performing or coordinating with the hosting organization on day-to-day system operational and administrative tasks related to a system is the Receiving Organization. The Receiving Organization identifies a Sustainment Manager to oversee Receiving Organization responsibilities. Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO) Transition, Release, and Support (TRS) is the primary Receiving Organization for sustainment of IT projects. Hosting may occur internally with IT Operations and Services (ITOPS) or externally with a vendor (e.g. Cloud). While TRS generally serves as the Receiving Organization, exceptions may be made when projects are deemed "infrastructure only" and will be entirely supported by ITOPS or, a special exception exists. The Receiving Organization Representative, known as the Sustainment Manager, is one of the three decision-makers (VIP Triad) for CD1s and CD2s. In addition, the Receiving Organization is engaged in the Project Close-Out Phase actions as part of the transition process to the Sustainment Phase of the Product Lifecycle. Involvement of the Receiving Organization early in the project lifecycle allows the organization to anticipate impacts to future product sustainment resources.

### 1.5.6 Project Manager

The Project Team designs, develops, and delivers the product. An OIT Project Manager (PM) leads the team, and is responsible for delivering a secure and usable product on time, on budget and in scope to the Product Owner (Section 1.5.1). The PM keeps the project on track, manages project goals and scope, tracks reporting requirements, and ensures delivery. Assembly of this team can occur from portfolio resources, other VA resources or resources acquired via a contract award.

The PM ensures:

- The VIP Dashboard must be updated within three business days
- Entries for Initial Operating Capability (IOC) Production, with the IOC Entry and IOC Exit dates, are added to the Planning and On-Line Activity/Release Integration Scheduler (POLARIS) calendar
- New systems are registered in the VA Systems Inventory (VASI) per Directive 6404

### 1.5.7 Program Manager

Programs are a limited collection of similar projects, delivering comparable work, generally addressing related applications or requirements and Product Owners in comparable situations. Projects may include products and/or services, and the Program Manager is responsible for participating in defining and prioritizing the Program Backlog. This specific backlog drives the delivery of work performed by the Program Manager. The Program Manager is also responsible for removing impediments at the Program level. This individual works with the Portfolio Director to understand objectives, budget, portfolio, and program requirements.

Program Managers should ensure that the PMs within their programs are:

- Delivering a product that meets users' requirements
- Adhering to VIP policy and procedures
- Delivering **on-time** , **on-budget** and **within scope**
- Tracking and delivering valid data for reporting requirements

### 1.5.8 Scrum Master

A Scrum Master is a servant leader who ensures that the Project Team understands and implements Agile practices. The contractor is responsible for providing a Scrum Master for the project. If the project does not have any contracted resources, someone from the Project Team is assigned to be the Scrum Master. The Scrum Master, in coordination with the PM, is responsible for:

- Facilitating the daily standup/Scrum meeting
- Helping the team maintain their Burndown Chart and Velocity
- Facilitating Sprint Planning sessions, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives
- Assisting in Build Planning
- Shielding the team from interruptions during the Sprint
- Removing obstacles that affect the team
- Assisting the Product Owner in User Story development
- Assisting Product Owner in prioritizing backlog items
- Encouraging collaboration between the Scrum team and Product Owner

### 1.5.9 EPMO VIP Business Office

VIP Business Office (VBO) falls under Project Special Forces (PSF), a division of the Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO), and is responsible for overseeing the VIP Lifecycle. Additionally, the VBO team will collect and analyze all performance data to enhance accountability within OIT.

### 1.5.10 OIT Governance Boards

The IT Governance Framework gives all OIT senior executives the opportunity to contribute their subject matter expertise to specialized Governance Boards, where they will serve alongside business partners. Detailed information on the Boards can be found at the [OIT Governance site](https://vaww.oit.va.gov/governance/). One of the boards provides direct oversight of the VIP governance process, ensures that best practices of Agile product development and delivery are followed (i.e., Epics, Process Owner, PM), and that accountability for meeting budget, schedule, resources, scope, and key gates are managed appropriately.

### 1.5.11 IT Operations and Services Implementation Manager

The IT Operations and Services (ITOPS) Implementation Manager focuses on the implementation of the product. The ITOPS Implementation Manager does the intensive planning and coordination work to support implementing information systems or new processes into the business environment, including a seamless transition of the product into an operational state. For projects that require implementation support, an Implementation Manager will be assigned to support the PM. The Implementation Manager will provide focused coordination of the deployment and implementation activities. PMs may request an ITOPS Implementation Manager and other ITOPS resource via an email to OIT ITOPS Service Request [VAITOPS.ServiceRequest@va.gov](mailto:VAITOPS.ServiceRequest@va.gov). Many service requests are more implementation-oriented and do not require a PM. An ITOPS Implementation Manager can be assigned to lead non-VIP efforts that do not: require enterprise or multi-district deployment; involve new construction; require new solution design development, interfaces, integration with other systems, platform engineering, major acquisitions, or district-wide or site-level implementations of previously developed/tested configurations. This work would be entered through VIPR, and the Demand Management Office would determine which efforts would be directly routed to ITOPS in collaboration with ITOPS representatives participating in the VIPR discovery and review processes.

### 1.5.12 Release Agent

The primary role of the Release Agent is to monitor, audit, and report on the completeness, integrity, and traceability of the project data associated with a release. The Release Agent provides information about release requirements and feedback about the status of project data to the Project Team and other Stakeholders. The Release Agent also collects metrics at certain points and intervals. This feedback enables the Project Team to address any deficiencies as quickly as possible.

Prior to any software/hardware being moved into a production environment (i.e., prior to IOC Entry and again prior to IOC Exit or national release), the Release Agent ensures that the Portfolio Director, Product Owner, and the Receiving Organization Representative have the most recent status of the completeness and traceability among product requirements, testing, and deliverables for the proposed release.

### 1.5.13 Health Product Support (HPS) Application Coordinator(AC)

The HPS AC, or equivalent, is a member of the Project Team developing new health products, enhancing health products, or sustaining health products. The HPS AC serves as a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Subject Matter Expert (SME) to the PM, Release Agent (RA), and Project Team and is responsible for assisting with coordinating the activities for the national release of health products and/or VistA patches, ensuring a smooth transition of the assigned health product or VistA patch from development to Health Product Support for sustainment. The AC performs a technical review working closely with the developers and test sites, reviewing all required project documentation, installing and testing Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of VistA patches, and when applicable, testing of new health products prior to national release of the health product or VistA patch. All findings will be stored in the approved OIT Rational Tools Suite as part of the product.

### 1.5.14 Strategic Technology Alignment Team

The Strategic Technology Alignment Team (STAT) assists in guiding IT Program and Project Managers in the alignment of business and IT functions to VA Enterprise Architecture (EA) standards, such as Design, Engineering and Architecture (DE&amp;A) Epics, Security Epics, One-VA Technical Reference Model (TRM), and Enterprise Design Patterns (EDPs). A STAT Agent is assigned to support each project delivering a product under the VIP process. The STAT Agent assignment process is identical to the Release Agent assignment process previously detailed and generally occurs following Release Agent assignment.

STAT Agents are embedded SMEs that are aligned by portfolio/program and provide DE&amp;A requirements and Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling assistance and advisory services. The role of the STAT Agent is to support project teams as they complete IBM® Rational Tools Suite DE&amp;A activities, build UML models, and report DE&amp;A results to the Release Agent and CD2 VIP Triad. Overall, the STAT Agent provides right time / right level enterprise and security architecture assistance and facilitates real-time technical analysis, evaluation and recommendations. To request STAT Agent support, please send an email to [STATAgentSupport@va.gov](mailto:STATAgentSupport@va.gov) or visit the STAT Agent Assignment site.

## 1.6 Flexibility of Project Requirements

Portfolio Directors can tailor VIP project requirements to accommodate a specific body of work.In rare instances, primarily for high-risk/high-visibility products, Portfolio Directors can add additional requirements they deem necessary beyond the core set of required artifacts, if it is in the best interest of the VA enterprise to hold the product to additional scrutiny.
