**Figure 13: VIP Lifecycle – Scrum Lifecycle**

All VA OIT projects must implement the Agile Methodology. This includes Development, Infrastructure, COTS, and Sustainment projects. PMs must execute projects using Scrum, the chosen VA Agile framework. See Figure 13 for the Scrum Lifecycle. Scrum is a simple set of principles and practices that help Project Teams deliver products in short cycles, enabling quick feedback, continuous improvement, and rapid adaptation to change. VIP provides a more flexible framework in which Agile delivery can occur at the speed that the Project Team is able to deliver.

Agile requirements are structured in the form of Epics, Sub-Epics, and User Stories. The two types of requirements used within OIT are Business Requirements and Alignment Requirements.

Business Requirements directly deliver the business value of a product or solution. Once these requirements are broken down into User Stories, an Agile Project Team is responsible for delivering these User Stories from the Product Backlog using a common Sprint cadence and coordination to align with other teams within the Project or Program. The following is the minimum criteria for executing a project; however, a Project Team may incorporate additional Agile practices as needed. Teams use Daily Scrums and Burndown Charts to monitor work progress and impediments.

Scrum of Scrums are held to keep management informed and to request assistance with resolving impediments at both the Program and Portfolio levels. The teams deliver working products in Sprints of one to four weeks. Before the team begins their Sprint they must define the **Definition of Done**. **Definition of Done** is when all conditions (acceptance criteria) that a product must satisfy are met, to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming project. Throughout the Sprint, the Product Backlog is groomed and prioritized as the requirements are further refined. During Sprint Planning, the team commits to a set of User Stories to be completed during the Sprint, based on their Capacity and Velocity. The Product Owner should be an active participant in Sprint Planning and Backlog Grooming, prioritizing and elaborating on requirements, and fielding questions from the Agile Team. The product is built and tested during Sprint execution. At the Sprint Review, the product is demonstrated to the Stakeholders and accepted by the Product Owner. At the end of the Sprint, the team attends a Sprint Retrospective to reflect on lessons learned. The process is repeated for the next Sprint.

Alignment Requirements ensure a product meets legal and technical standards for operation and support the development of business initiatives. Similar to Business Requirements, these standards come in the form of Epics, Sub-Epics, and User Stories. These standards may also include non-functional requirements or those requirements that describe the characteristics of a system, rather than specific actions that system should perform. The five Alignment groups include Section 508 Compliance, Strategic Technology Alignment Team (STAT), Security, Release, and Sustainment. While these requirements have been standardized across OIT, representatives from these groups will assist in tailoring these requirements to the specifics of each product. The Alignment representatives will also be involved throughout the lifecycle of the project to ensure that the product is successfully meeting and implementing all required OIT standards.

The Project Team should be cross-functional containing all skills needed to deliver a product. This includes, but is not limited to, analysts, architects, designers, developers, configuration managers, technical writers, testers, and a Scrum Master.

To support this effort, Appendix A provides a guide of Agile terminology with "plain language" translations.

## 4.2 Required Artifacts

Along with VIP's new unified release process and the IT management efficiencies derived from the Agile development methodologies and project/program/portfolio construct, OIT secures a significant reduction in required documentation. Below is the required documentation for each Critical Decision. The list represents the minimum set of data required exclusive of Security/ATO, and Section 508 requirements. In most cases, this is also the maximum amount of artifacts. However, VIP is tailorable, so at the discretion of the Portfolio Director, data/artifact requirements can be added to this list.

### 4.2.1 Critical Decision 1

1. Requirements (Epics, Sub-Epics and User Stories) Data/Approval in Rational Tools
2. Risks – Data/Approval in Rational Tools
3. An approved and signed Project Management Plan (PMP)
4. An approved and signed Acquisition and Financial Management Plan (AFMP)

### 4.2.2 Critical Decision 2

1. Traceability (requirements to test cases)/Test Execution/Test Results/Defect Log, – Data/Approval in Rational Tools
2. Version Description Document (VDD)
3. An approved and signed Production Operations Manual (POM), unless it is a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)] product, in which requires a Technical Manual rather than a POM – a Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) chart should accompany the POM or Technical Manual
4. Deployment and Installation, Back-out, and Rollback Plan
5. User Guide
6. Authority to Operate (ATO)
7. Section 508 Validation Status
8. Contracts/Licensing/ Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
9. Any CD1 artifacts that were updated since the CD1

Templates for CD1 and CD2 required artifacts are located on the [VIP SharePoint](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Pages/Assessment%20and%20Reporting.aspx) site.

## 4.3 VIP Governance Process

VIP creates an environment capable of delivering frequent releases more often through a deeper embrace of Agile development methodologies. VIP captures Agile methodology in one integrated development and release process. It is a revolutionary change focused on the product or application being developed to benefit the Veteran. Through reducing oversight to the minimum necessary and separating what we must do from what we should do, VIP is now the single authoritative process that IT projects must follow to ensure delivery of IT products.

OIT oversight processes have been modified in the VIP policy framework, exclusive of Section 508, Security, and Authority to Operate (ATO). A governance structure is also established whereby the DAS EPMO is the only approval authority to allow any changes, additions, or modifications to VIP. No additional oversight requirements can be levied upon the Portfolio Directors without the DAS EPMO's explicit approval.

One of the IT Governance boards will guide/advise the DAS EPMO as to recommended changes to VIP which may arise in the future. Any changes will be evaluated against the risk of not adding the additional process step, versus the value/benefits the new process step could contribute to the enterprise. By establishing this IT governance, OIT ensures the VIP process remains streamlined and enhances accountability.

## 4.4 VIP Issue Escalation Process

VIP relies heavily on the project/program/portfolio hierarchical construct for organizing and managing the delivery of VA's IT products. Similar projects are grouped together into Programs, and Programs are grouped into Portfolios. Resources assigned in this construct include PMs, Program Managers, and Portfolio Directors.

Given the shortened release cycles in VIP, it is vital that impediments are removed or mitigated in a timely manner. VIP relies on Scrum Masters and PMs at the Project level to resolve impediments as soon as they are discovered, generally in the daily Scrum.

As seen in Figure 14, if the impediment cannot be removed, the PM should escalate it to the Program level at the Scrum of Scrums which occurs twice a week. The Program Managers are responsible for removing impediments at the Program level. If this level of management is unable to do so, or if the impediment requires action at a higher level, the Program Manager should escalate the impediment to the Portfolio level in the weekly Super Scrum of Scrums.

The Portfolio Directors are responsible for removing impediments at the Portfolio level. If they are unable to do so, then this level of management should escalate the impediment to the EPMO and OIT executives who make decisions that can remove or mitigate the impediment. The elevation of impediments through this construct should take no longer than one (1) week.

**VIP encourages and empowers participants, at all levels,** to take charge of issues and resolve them amongst themselves whenever possible. Escalation beyond the portfolio level will rarely be required. Communication and transparency is paramount, hence, the daily Scrums, Scrum of Scrums, and Super Scrum of Scrums are very important.

As the project/program/portfolio organizational construct becomes ingrained in the organization, VA expects the risk management process provided through this hierarchy will handle the majority of risk mitigation.

**Figure 14: VIP Escalation Hierarchy**

For the enterprise to benefit from lessons learned gathered during the Sprint Retrospective, Portfolio Directors will collect and categorize the risks raised within their portfolio. Categorization of risks raised at the project, program, or portfolio level is the responsibility of the PM, Program Manager, and Portfolio Director respectively. The categories or risks can be found in the VIP Dashboard.

## 4.5 Leveraging Lessons Learned from VIP/Technical Review (TechRev)

Another excellent source of lessons learned is the deep dive dissection and analysis OIT does of every delivery that misses its project commitments. This deep dive is called a Technical Review (TechRev). This activity will remain an element of VIP, because without it, there is no data from which to identify areas for organizational improvement. These deep dive analysis sessions remain as evidence-based accountability reviews of an IT project with VA leadership. The sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in a program/portfolio, turning around underperforming projects/programs, or terminating work, as appropriate.

The VBO team will host all deep dive analyses. They will be attended by the Project and Program Managers of the affected project. Categorizations of the reason the project missed its commitment will be done by the VBO. Summaries of each Root Cause Analysis (RCA) will be maintained by the VBO and provided to the CIO on a quarterly basis.

OIT is striving to remain an evolving, learning organization with a rich source of data to continually renew itself and ensure consistent delivery of IT capabilities with an ever-increasing speed to delivery.
