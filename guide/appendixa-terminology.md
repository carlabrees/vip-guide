Task | A specific action that is taken to satisfy a User Story measured in hours
Backlog | An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
Build Backlog | The prioritized list of functionality that will be delivered within a build of three months or less
Sprint Backlog | A prioritized list of work a team commits to completing during a Sprint
Build | The measurable period of time to deliver functionality—not to exceed three months planned length
Sprint | A set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review that is typically 1-4 weeks in length
Scrum of Scrums | Cross-team meeting to communicate progress; teams communicate progress by answering four questions: What did the team do since we last met?, What will the team do before we meet again?, Is anything slowing the team down or getting in their way?, Is the team about to put something in another team's way?

User Story Points | Unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work
