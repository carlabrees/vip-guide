# 2 VIP Lifecycle

VIP creates a streamlined IT oversight process that further uses the Agile Project Management Methodology. The following sections of the VIP Guide outline the phases of development of an IT project, from Intake to Sustainment, as depicted through the VIP Lifecycle.

**Figure 1: The VIP Lifecycle**

## 2.1 VIP Request (VIPR) Intake

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42825062-317340de-89af-11e8-96ea-066d05591662.png)

**Figure 2: VIP Lifecycle – Intake**

The VIP Request (VIPR) Intake Process (See C.15) is the only way to request new or enhanced VA IT capabilities. In conjunction with the VIPR Tool, it is a mechanism to access expertise to help in the identification and analysis of IT solutions that satisfy business needs while delivering the best value to VA, as well as to identify the IT funding and/or resources required to implement and/or maintain those solutions. The VIPR Intake Process ensures Product Owner requests are validated, analyzed, and/or transitioned to service providers for execution. The VIPR Intake Process is often the avenue to obtain operational infrastructure, application sustainment, development or other specialized support in coordination with the Account Management Office.

VIPR Intake is the process through which OIT absorbs the problem statement and starts to envision a designed solution. A clear objective for the product must be defined during this stage, and be clearly represented in the problem statement. The problem statement must be written by the Product Owner in collaboration with the ITAM and, as applicable, the Project Team. Defining the problem statement is one of the most critical parts of any product development process, as it identifies all work that follows. As the business requirements become better defined, a unique identifier, called a VIPR number, is assigned at project intake.

All project members should be familiar with the basic Business Epic that is entered into the VIPR tool. Once the project is approved, this Business Epic is the first statement that should be entered into Rational Tools.

When a project is accepted through VIPR Intake, an Enterprise Project Structure (EPS) number is assigned, a PM is assigned, and the project is entered into the VIP Dashboard. Entry into the VIP Dashboard moves the project from Intake to the Initiation Phase.

## 2.2 Initiation Phase

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826183-cd159e04-89b1-11e8-88b2-8a61e974cea8.png)

**Figure 3: VIP Lifecycle – Initiation**

In the Initiation Phase, high level Business Epics are further defined into an initial set of Epics that will prepare the project for success in the Project Phase. Following the Agile methodologies, IT product requirements are expressed in terms of Epics and User Stories. OIT captures all necessary data in the Epics to satisfy product requirements.

OIT's ability to remove certain review functions is dependent on data being entered in online tools (VIPR, Rational Tools Suite, etc.) and accessible by members of the portfolio, project, or support teams. As Epics are built, they must be available in the Rational Tools repository for review. This includes the Business Epics and the various Alignment Epics (including Section 508, Design, Engineering, and Architecture (DE&A), Security, etc.). For assistance with Alignment Epics, please send an email to [epics@va.gov](mailto:EPICS@VA.GOV).

The Business and Alignment Epics (Figure 4) should include hardware, software, security, development, environments, cloud and other services, and sustainment requirements necessary to create the capability. VA Enterprise Architecture standards and reference architectures will be leveraged at all times, unless an emerging requirement provides a need for a new technology solution.

**Figure 4: Relationship of Epics to Solution(s)**

## 2.3 Project Phase

### 2.3.1 Project Planning

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826313-1e8d2a5e-89b2-11e8-8e80-914f11851e9d.png)

**Figure 5: VIP Lifecycle – Project Planning**

Project planning occurs within the Project Phase, to ensure the project is resourced correctly (funding, resources, and contracts) for a successful product delivery. During planning, and throughout the life of the product, **Project and Program Managers must maintain an audit file that supports how costs and budget information were derived for individual builds and total lifecycle product costs**. The sources used for the cost estimates could include the Budget Tracking Tool (BTT), Primavera historical product cost data, Integrated Funds Control, Accounting, and Procurement (IFCAP), and others, and must be documented. Capital costs, as part of Development, Maintenance, and Enhancement (DME), the funding most often used by IT projects, can include:

- Hardware
- Software development and acquisition costs
- Commercial off-the-shelf acquisition costs
- Government labor costs
- Contracted labor costs for planning, development, acquisition, system integration
- Direct project management and overhead support
- Costs of migrating/sustain the product in the Cloud

All applicable costs must be included to arrive at the total lifecycle project costs.

Project planning includes specifying all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and [Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](http://vaww.oed.wss.va.gov/process/Public/API/DisplayProcessOverview3.html?ID=SLM). The Release Agent should ensure the aforementioned is captured in the Business Epic and Sub-Epic record(s) for the project entered in the approved tool. Before the conclusion of this phase, a Critical Decision 1 (CD1) will occur.

High level but important activities that occur during the Project Phase include:

- Forming a project team
- Elaborating Business and Alignment Epics into sub-Epics
- Generating a PWS as required
- Identifying the Receiving Organization
- Identifying Initial Operating Capability (IOC) requirements (if appropriate)
- Creating a Primavera project entry

The Receiving Organization should be the group responsible for ongoing sustainment of the product upon closure of the project. The Receiving Organization's sustainment responsibilities will be led by a Sustainment Manager. Usually sustainment support will come from EPMO's Transition, Release, and Support (TRS) Office.

During the Project Phase, a Release Agent is assigned to monitor the release. For any questions regarding the process, please contact the Release Readiness Office at [OITEPMOTRSRROReleaseAgents@va.gov](mailto:OITEPMOTRSRROReleaseAgents@va.gov).

The Release Agent's role is to enhance the likelihood of a successful release by reviewing and ensuring that information provided by the Project Team, including appropriate project data, is being managed in the repositories within the Rational Tools Suite. For more information about the role of the Release Agent, please refer to Section 1.5 of this document.

It is essential that all releases, whether IOC or national release, be added to the POLARIS calendar as early as possible, and is updated regularly. Assistance from the POLARIS user community in providing this essential information will greatly enhance the ability of OIT and Veterans Health Administration to successfully plan limited resources to support the multiple product IOC Production events and deployment to field sites.

The ideal time to create an entry in POLARIS is around the time of a CD1, or before, when the need-by date is communicated. The date can be easily updated all the way up to the week before release. The next best time to create or update the POLARIS entry, is just after contract award when the proposed/estimated completion date should be known.

### 2.3.2 Critical Decision 1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826413-530de7dc-89b2-11e8-81c4-eb1575fc7b6d.png)

**Figure 6: VIP Lifecycle – Critical Decision 1**

A Critical Decision 1 (CD1) occurs when a project is ready to begin the process of moving to the Product Phase. This can be done in order to acquire contract resources for the Product Phase if contract resources are required, or to acquire FTE resources. The approval is given by the VIP Triad at a CD1. The VIP Triad decision for a CD1 can be: Approve or Disapprove; there is no "Approve with Conditions". CD1 artifacts can be found under Section 4.2.1, Required Artifacts, in this guide. Templates for CD1 required artifacts can be found on the [VIP SharePoint](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Pages/Assessment%20and%20Reporting.aspx)site.

By CD1, a project should have its scope, schedule, resources, documentation and acquisitions planned, along with any risks identified, funding secured, IOC sites determined, and documentation updated. The effort retains its VIPR unique number for the Calendaring and Release processes. The Program Manager should review projects prior to the CD1, but this is at the discretion of the Program Manager.

VIP only requires a single CD1 per project which validates the project is ready to move forward with acquisition (a contract), or ready to receive FTE resources, thus allowing the project to continue planning until ready to begin builds. While the CD1 template requests feedback on builds, the PM is not committed to the future build dates at the time of the CD1. Future builds presented on the build slide in the CD1 are proposed and not committed; as dates cannot be accurately determined until all resources have been on-boarded and planning is completed. **Build dates are not committed until the PM enters them into the VIP Dashboard as an Approved build, with Planned Dates for Start and Completion**. Once the build is approved in the VIP Dashboard, the Planned Start Date and Planned Completion Date cannot be changed without Program Planning and Oversight (PPO) and VIP support. A CD1 does not have to list all builds for the entire project. Per VIP policy, a Portfolio Director does not have to approve all builds at a CD1.

VIP policy does not mandate that any build needs a formal approval before starting, outside of the project Scrum meeting. However, a Portfolio Director can decide to have an approval for every build for every project, or, make that decision on a project-by-project basis. The Portfolio Director may also choose to handle build approvals through a Scrum of Scrums, Super Scrum of Scrums, or via the Program Manager.

When the Portfolio Director, Product Owner, or Receiving Organization Representative is not available to act as the approving official for CD1s  and VIP Artifacts, a duly signed Delegation of Authority (DOA) authorizes specific employees to act as a Voting Proxy on behalf of their respective position. This DOA memo must be on file with the VBO.

### 2.3.3 Contract Award and On-Boarding

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826452-6c6a3cb2-89b2-11e8-9a78-58baa56175d4.png)

**Figure 7: VIP Lifecycle – Contract Award and Onboarding**

This stage is necessary only if the product requires an acquisition and/or contract support. During this period, the Project Team should work closely with the Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) to ensure that the Performance Work Statement is written so that the contractor(s) shall follow both an Agile Methodology and the VIP established by OIT to enable an Agile, user-centered process.

## 2.4 Product Phase

### 2.4.1 Product Phase Start and Build Start

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826486-7f908274-89b2-11e8-9e87-ba7c07712252.png)

**Figure 8: VIP Lifecycle – Product Phase Start and Build Start**

Projects should be in the Product Phase for no longer than 18 months, with development cycles lasting three months or less. To exceed 18 months, (but no longer than 20 months), the PM must obtain the approval of the VIP Triad.

**NOTE** : The Project Team should deliver **releases as rapidly as possible** during the Product Phase.

Projects which exceed 20 months in the Product Phase should be closed and reopened under a new project. Under extenuating circumstances where closing and starting a new project is not advantageous to VA, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS), Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO) has the authority to override current policy, and allow the project to exceed 20 months. Projects needing more than 20 months will need to seek approval through a [signed exception memorandum](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Pages/Assessment and Reporting.aspx) from the DAS EPMO to continue to build and develop functionality.

**NOTE:** The project is only allowed to submit one exception memo.

In VIP, a development cycle is called a **build**. Builds are not to exceed three months planned length, but can be of a shorter duration. The goal should always be to **deliver functionality into production at the end of a build**. However, a build would be **considered on-time** if the functionality passed User Acceptance Testing (UAT), was accepted by the Product Owner, and **was placed into a Pre-Production** or **Production environment** at the end of the build cycle. Each build that develops code should submit their code to the EPMO Open Source Coordination Office.

### 2.4.2 Build and Development

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826520-9cb94412-89b2-11e8-941d-08b1043b2bba.png)

**Figure 9: Build Development Cycle**

Build and Development should begin after the start of the onboarding of contractors. Each build is not to exceed three months planned length. VIP provides a flexible development framework in which Agile teams can **release as rapidly as they are capable** , so a Project Team could choose to have 6, 12, 18, or more builds.

The Product Phase is divided into builds, which are further divided into Sprints. A build can have multiple Sprints within it, or each Sprint could be considered its own build. Regardless of the length of the cycle or Sprint, as determined by the Project Team, everyone must follow the standard development cycle.

Builds can be for development, IOC testing, release, or other activities depending on the project type. Builds that are for development should strive to end with a push to production, but pre-production and a completed UAT is acceptable. UAT in pre-production is a signed validation of the functionality from the Product Owner and users. If critical defects are found, resolution needs to occur immediately. Less severe defects can be deferred to the next release depending on the severity of the defect. A defect is a deviation from requirement or standard, such as a failure to meet customer acceptance criteria. Defects could also occur as flaws or imperfections in a software product or process. In an Agile environment, testing and defect resolution should be completed within the same Sprint and/or build.

### 2.4.3 Critical Decision 2

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826551-b2edd612-89b2-11e8-9703-4a7fddbe6a9b.png)

**Figure 10: VIP Lifecycle – Critical Decision 2**

A Critical Decision 2 (CD2) occurs after all (pre-IOC) testing is complete and the PM believes the build or product is ready for release and addresses all relevant compliance requirements. This decision should answer the following questions:

1.	What are the systems this product interfaces with and is it compatible with all of them?
2.	Have all sustainment operations and maintenance costs been addressed, including Technical Debt?
3.	Who are the Stakeholders and teams directly affected by this new product, and are they aware of the impending release?
4.	Does the system meet applicable Alignment Epics, Alignment Sub-Epics, and Alignment User Stories?
5.	Has all required testing associated with Alignment Epics been completed and documented?
6.	Has all required regression and end-to-end testing been completed, and all documentation updated?
7.	Have all required Quality Assurance Reviews been completed and documented?

The Release Agent assigned to the project will publish a Release Readiness Report distributed to the VIP Triad and other Stakeholders prior to any production release (either IOC Production, General Availability, or a national production environment – but not pre-prod). The Release Readiness Report provides the VIP Triad (Portfolio Director, Product Owner, and Receiving Organization Representative) with the most up-to-date picture of the quality and completeness of the release candidate, so the VIP Triad can make an informed decision regarding approval/disapproval of the release.

The Portfolio Director, Product Owner, Receiving Organization Representative(VIP Triad) approves or disapproves the product for release. The VIP Triad decision for a CD2 can be: Approve or Disapprove; there is no "Approve with Conditions". CD2 artifacts should be provided to the VIP Triad in a timely manner before CD2. When the Portfolio Director, Product Owner, or Receiving Organization Representative is not available to act as the approving official for CD2s and VIP Artifacts, a Delegation of Authority (DOA) memo, authorizes specific employees to act as a Voting Proxy on behalf of their respective position.

The VIP requirement for a CD2 should be tailored by the VIP Triad. If no product is being delivered into production, then a CD2 is not required.

This decision reviews the full product, and if nothing significant changes in the product's technical environment or security profile, by VIP policy, **approvals are not required for future releases**. This means the only release that requires a full CD2 is the first release into production. Once this first release occurs, subsequent CD2s may be held at the discretion of the VIP Triad, simply to ensure the proper requirements have been updated and the appropriate parties are prepared for the additional release(s). CD2 Artifacts can be found under Section 4.2.2, Required Artifacts. Templates for CD2 required artifacts can be found on the [VIP SharePoint](https://vaww.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/OIT/epmo/vip/Pages/Assessment%20and%20Reporting.aspx) site.

#### Use of IOC Implementation Model

If a project uses the IOC implementation model, CD2 approval means that the product is approved to begin implementation at the first IOC test site. Implementation at an IOC test site is not an indication that the Product Phase is complete. The Portfolio Director, Product Owner, and Receiving Organization Representative (VIP Triad) may need to approve the IOC release for further implementation.

The Project Team executes the deployment plan or standard deployment process. This deploys the IOC product into a limited number of production sites. Personnel track issues, changes, and the significance of changes during IOC. Then, the aforementioned data elements must be recorded in the appropriate Rational Tools repositories.

- If defects are significant enough to endanger the success of the release, to impair performance or availability of the new product or an existing product or system, or to cause the threshold for deployment to be breached, personnel execute the back-out and return to the appropriate phase of the process. The threshold for installation and availability is a stated amount of time (usually established by the operations shop that installs the product) in which the product must be installed and operational. For example, if the threshold is 2 hours from the start of installation and the product is not operational after 2 hours and 5 minutes, the back-out must occur.

- If defects are not significant, personnel conclude the IOC and prepare for full deployment into production.

Upon successful completion of IOC, as determined by approved acceptance criteria, the Release Agent must be notified.

**NOTE** : The Release Readiness Office provides the Release Readiness Report to the VIP Triad the day before the CD2 or if no CD2 occurs, the day before the release.

### 2.4.4 Release Preparation and Release

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826594-cbf90a50-89b2-11e8-9951-3a6437295b81.png)

**Figure 11: VIP Lifecycle – Release Preparation and Release**

A release is an installation into an **IOC production environment** or **a national production environment**. If a release equals installation into an IOC production environment, this occurs within the Product Phase. It typically refers to hardware or software, and includes IOC, full deployment, subsequent releases, maintenance releases, defect repairs, security and other patches, and any changes that are released into production.

The period after release approval is given, and when the actual release occurs, is expected to be within two weeks after the release approval. Activities in this phase include preparing final release communications, making final environment updates if necessary, and finalizing site logistics. The VIP Triad approves or disapproves the product for release. CD2 artifacts should be provided to the VIP Triad in a timely manner before CD2.

At the end of the IOC evaluation, the Release Agent again reviews the data and provides a status notification to the VIP Triad and other stakeholders. This additional notification provides decision-makers an opportunity to reassess the forward progress of the Release Candidate, based on IOC results. If no significant defects were identified during the IOC, the Release Candidate continues on to national release. Prior to national release, all product data must be entered into the proper Rational Tools repository. Additionally, the Project Team must update the POLARIS Calendar with scheduled dates for release. Full Operating Capability (FOC) occurs when the final national release is implemented.

## 2.5 Paused Status

A project enters the Paused Status when it hits a major roadblock such as a major re-plan between builds, lack of funding, a lack of critical resources, or anything that causes the Project Team to be unable to deliver. This decision is recommended by the PM and approved by either the VIP Triad or other appropriate OIT governance process. **A project can be placed into a Paused Status for no more than three months** ; this will not count against the total 18-month Product Phase limit. If the project is still in Paused Status after three months, the VIP Triad must review for next steps.There are three Paused Status types:

1. **Paused-Planning** : If a project is in the Product Phase and needs to pause between two builds to re-plan before starting the next build, it can do so. This could be due to a contract modification, technical issue(s) that need to be addressed before developing the next build, or other activities that would prevent the next build from being successful. These issues can be addressed while the project is in the Paused-Planning Status.
2. **Paused-Unfunded** : A project could be placed in the Paused-Unfunded Status when part or all of its DME funding has been withdrawn, but the business requirements are still valid and a high priority. A project could be waiting until funding is reestablished, through an Unfunded Request (UFR), or some other method. No DME work is to be performed until funding is reestablished. If DME funding was lost for a development project, but sustainment funding for the project is available, maintenance work and minor enhancements/patches could continue, while the project is paused to redefine scope and obtain funding.
3. **Paused-Provisioning** : A project could be placed in Paused-Provisioning Status if, for example, the project encounters a lack of resources or a contractual issue, such as a protested award on a re-compete contract. Only minimal work can be accomplished until resources are available. Activities to address a protested contract award could be done, and requirements grooming by government FTE can continue. The extent of activities depends upon the issue(s), and will be decided by the VIP Triad. Placing the project in Paused-Provisioning Status means that the project has the potential to resume in the near future.

The criteria for entering the Paused Status is defined and approved by the project's VIP Triad or other appropriate OIT governance process. The decision to enter or exit the Paused Status is documented via meeting minutes or email, and stored in the appropriate project repository and the VIP SharePoint site, by sending the documentation to the VBO ([vavip@va.gov](mailto:vavip@va.gov)).

### 2.5.1 Project Tasks

A Paused Status project does not conduct any project tasks that deliver releases. If the build is returning to the Product Phase from the Paused Status, the original planned completion date committed to and approved by the VIP Triad (+/- 10%) remains the date from which the on-time delivery of the project will be measured.

### 2.5.2 Required Reporting

VIP projects in Paused Status must continue reporting in the VIP Dashboard. The reporting requirements for the VIP Dashboard are described in the VIP Dashboard User's Guide. The PM, or designee, must review the information in the VIP Dashboard regularly. If there is a change in the required reportable data, the **VIP Dashboard must be updated within three business days**.

### 2.5.3 Required Reviews

Required reviews depend on whether the project is in a Paused-Planning, Paused-Provisioning, or Paused-Unfunded status.

#### Paused-Planning and Paused-Provisioning Projects

These projects must be evaluated every month by the VIP Triad for progress toward moving back to the Product Phase, _or they will be subject to closure_. The VIP Triad, in addition to the DAS, EPMO have the authority to close the project based on this review. The intent of this requirement is to ensure that senior leaders within EPMO are aware of and evaluating these projects. If the project is closed by the VIP Triad or DAS, EPMO, the project staff has three business days to close the project in the VIP Dashboard. The project is stopped and does not require further reviews. Guidance and processes for conducting the monthly reviews are the responsibility of the VIP Triad and/or Portfolio Director.

#### Paused-Unfunded Projects

The Program Manager or Portfolio Director will evaluate Paused-Unfunded projects every month to determine the continuing business need and/or its eligibility for funding. The intent of this requirement is to ensure that senior leaders are aware of and evaluating these projects. Processes for conducting monthly reviews are the responsibility of the project's individual Portfolio. Paused-Unfunded projects should be moved back to the Product Phase once they receive new funding.

## 2.6 Product Transition and Project Close Out

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16787361/42826651-e59955be-89b2-11e8-9757-b6693d48adbd.png)

**Figure 12: VIP Lifecycle – Product Transition and Project Close Out**

A critical element of VIP is that core members of the Project Team stay assigned to their product for three months following completion of the final build release. The PM, Portfolio Director, and Receiving Organization Representative determine the specific team members who must stay assigned. This ensures that core team members are available to mitigate any discovered development defects and readily address these defects in the software before final turnover to the sustaining organization. The product will transition to sustainment after the three-month defect resolution period is completed within the Close Out Phase. The length of the defect resolution period depends on the project type and how it was closed. Several examples include:

- Software development projects _should_ employ the three-month defect resolution period during the Close Out Phase for all Closed-Completed projects–exceptions must be approved by the VIP Triad
- The three-month defect resolution period may or may not apply to Closed-Stopped projects, depending on whether functionality was delivered into production, and based on the particular contract for that project
- The three-month defect resolution period _may_ not be applicable to non-software development projects found in the VIP Dashboard – final decision on applicability resides with the VIP Triad

During this three-month defect resolution period, core members of the Project Team are allowed to verify defects, develop fixes, test fixes, and then release them into production.

**NOTE** : No new functionality will be developed and deployed during this period.

At the conclusion of the defect resolution period, the PM enters either Closed-Completed or Closed-Stopped, Close Out Phase actual costs, the date the project actually closed, and the final project costs into the VIP Dashboard and close the project in Rational Tools. Final invoices from the contractor must be received and paid prior to entering the final project costs. Any requirements other than these are at the discretion of the Portfolio Director.

Within the Close Out Phase, the Project Team can select either Closed-Completed or Closed-Stopped (neither one has a minimum day limit) in the VIP Dashboard.

- Both will have a planned, projected, and actual start and finish date
- Both will have planned, projected, and actual costs
- The Close Out Phase data elements will be reported to OMB as required
