# VETERAN-FOCUSED INTEGRATION PROCESS GUIDE
### Version 3.1, APRIL 2018

## Approval for the Veteran-Focused Integration Process (VIP) Guide 3.1

The Veteran-focused Integration Process (VIP), a Lean-Agile framework, services the interest of Veterans through the efficient streamlining of Information Technology (IT) activities that occur within the IT enterprise. VIP is a significant step forward for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), allowing more frequent delivery of essential IT services, via a no longer than three-month cadence, and minimal oversight processes. VIP also enhances the ability to track and monitor IT performance and strengthens management oversight and accountability.

Any VA IT project effort that touches the VA network must utilize VIP, regardless of whether it spends government funding from VA's Congressional IT Appropriation or any other appropriation.

This guide provides direction, procedures, and processes that staff must follow for successful IT project management within VA. The guide serves as a reference of VIP policies, definitions and procedural regulations for VA and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) community. If there is a conflict with previously issued VA or OIT guidance or publications, the current version of the VIP Guide takes precedence.

As VA continually strives to improve project management effectiveness and efficiency, VA appreciates any insight that users can provide. Users should send their comments and suggestions for improvements of the VIP Guide to the VIP Business Office ( [vavip@va.gov](mailto:vavip@va.gov)) for review and consideration.
