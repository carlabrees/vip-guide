# VIP Guide
The Veteran-focused integration process(VIP) is a Lean-Agile framework services the interest of Veterans through the efficient streamlining of Information Technology (IT) activities that occur within the Department of Veterans Affairs IT enterprise.

Any VA IT project effort that touches the VA network must utilize VIP, regardless of whether it spends government funding from VA's Congressional IT Appropriation or any other appropriation.

The current version of the VIP policy in use at the Department is version 3.1. You can find a pdf copy of it [here](./docs/vip3_1.pdf). You can access a markdown version of the document within the guide directory. A full table of contents is available [here](./guide/table-of-contents.md), or you can navigate using the below links:
